# Omnichain Architecture

The Omnichain architecture is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and decentralized blockchain platform. The architecture consists of the following components:

## Node

The Node is the core component of the Omnichain architecture. It is responsible for validating transactions, creating blocks, and maintaining the blockchain state.

## Network

The Network is responsible for connecting nodes and enabling communication between them. It uses a peer-to-peer protocol to enable nodes to communicate with each other.

## Consensus

The Consensus mechanism is responsible for ensuring that all nodes agree on the state of the blockchain. It uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to ensure that nodes are incentivized to act honestly.

## Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. They are executed on the Omnichain platform and enable decentralized applications (dApps) to be built on top of the platform.

## Storage

The Storage component is responsible for storing the blockchain state and transaction data. It uses a distributed storage system to ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently.

## API

The API provides a interface for interacting with the Omnichain platform. It enables developers to build applications on top of the platform and interact with the blockchain.

## Wallet

The Wallet is a user-facing component that enables users to interact with the Omnichain platform. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving transactions, as well as managing smart contracts.
